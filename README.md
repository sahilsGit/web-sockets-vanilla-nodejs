# Web sockets from scratch - without hitting `npm install`.

This is a part of my [_**"Building stuff in Vanilla NodeJS without installing any external packages"**_](https://x.com/sahil_singh37/status/1759523537402868217?s=20) challenge where I try to build non-trivial stuff using raw NodeJS, nothing else.

## Why does this challenge exist?

This is to encourage depth -- rather than using else's package mechanically, it's forces me to:

- Dig deep beyond the layers of abstraction,
- Understand the underlying problem,
- Find out ways to solve them,
- And possibly learn some new low-level stuff. 

You can check out my twitter post below or read the Medium article I wrote to learn more.
